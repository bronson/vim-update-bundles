0.8     15 Jul 2011
- Support Vundle directives so both tools can read the same .vimrc.
- When pull fails, remove and re-clone the repo instead of aborting.
- vim-update-bundles no longer symlinks .vim and .vimrc into $HOME.
- Remove the dotfile_path option, it's not necessary anymore.
- Finding .vim and .vimrc has been simplified, see the readme.
- No longer trim 'vim-' from the front of repo names in ~/.vim/bundle.
- We now check for duplicate and conflicting Bundle entries.
- All known tests written, all todos fixed.  1.0 is close.

0.6     29 Jun 2011
- Added doc/bundle-log.txt. :help bundle-log to see it.
- Added --no-updates option to make adding/deleting bundles faster.
- Support single-letter options (-v for --verbose, -n for --no-updates).
- It's BundleCommand though Bundle-Command and BUNDLE COMMAND still work.
- Added --help and --version.
- Cleanups and doc fixes by Sorin Ionescu.
- bugfix: changing branch name would merge instead of switching branches.

0.4.1   11 May 2011
- Support vundle-style short repo names thanks to Chris Toomey

0.4.0   06 Mar 2011
- Greatly simplify path configuration thanks to Sorin Ionescu
- No longer use Ruby as config file format, it's just key=value now
  ("static=1" still works but it's $HOME instead of "#{ENV['HOME']}")
- Add the Static: directive thanks to Andreas Marienborg
- Remove submodule entries from .gitmodules and .git/config (also Sorin)

0.3.1   30 Oct 2010
- restore Ruby 1.8 compatibility (popen doesn't accept an array)
- promise to check rvm before releasing

0.3     29 Oct 2010
- added submodule support thanks to steeef.
- support putting .vim and .vimrc in custom locations using config options.
- every repo now automatically ignores doc/tags.
- BUNDLE and BUNDLE-COMMAND are now case-insensitive.
- If a BUNDLE-COMMAND fails, vim-update-bundles now exits immediately.

0.2     27 Oct 2010
- Added a pure ruby configuration file, ~/vim-update-bundles.rb
- Don't clean ".vim" from repo names. a.vim is "a.vim" and not just "a".
- Added verbose flag. Run ./vim-update-bundles --verbose=1 to hear everything.
- bugfix: repos weren't automatically fast-forwarding to the latest commit.
- added command line args: ./vim-update-bundles vimrc="$HOME/dots/vimrc"
  but they're not very useful in real life, only for testing.
- added some tests! "rake test" in the git repo to run them.
- created a changes file.

0.1     20 Sep 2010
- add ability to create new vim environment from scratch.
- add BUNDLE-COMMAND directive to run shell commands.
- remove dashes from directive (it's '" BUNDLE:' now, not '" --- BUNDLE:').
